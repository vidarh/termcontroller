# Termcontroller

A very basic Controller (in the MVC sense) for Ruby terminal
applications. This was pulled out of my text editor,
[Re](https://github.com/vidarh/re).

**YOU ALMOST CERTAINLY DO NOT YET WANT TO USE THIS FOR YOUR OWN CODE**

I do intend to clean it up and make it usable for others, but it's not
there yet - if you think it'd be useful for you, feel free to drop me a
message.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'termcontroller'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install termcontroller

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console`
for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake
install`. To release a new version, update the version number in
`version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create
a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem`
file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
